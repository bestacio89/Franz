Introduction
This GitHub repository serves as a public clone of a more advanced private Azure DevOps repository that I maintain. Here, you'll find essential components for building robust microservice frameworks tailored to your specific needs.

Key Features
Wide Database Compatibility: Seamlessly integrate with a variety of popular SQL and NoSQL databases, providing flexibility in your data management strategy. Secure Single Sign-On (SSO): Enhance security and simplify user access by leveraging a well-established SSO solution (implementation details withheld for security reasons). Dedicated Kafka Integration: Leverage Kafka's strengths for efficient distributed message queuing, ensuring reliable communication between your microservices. Distributed Logging (Under Development): I'm actively working on incorporating the powerful Elastic Search, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack for comprehensive distributed logging. This will significantly improve log management, analysis, and visualization. Project Status

This GitHub repository primarily serves as a reference point for the core framework components. While the code is functional, it's essential to be aware that the distributed logging functionality using the ELK stack is currently under development.

Getting Started
For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the private Azure DevOps repository, which includes more comprehensive documentation and security considerations.

Security Notice
Since this repository is a public clone of a private Azure DevOps repository, certain details, such as specific SSO implementation and potential security configurations, are intentionally omitted for security reasons.

Contributing
